# Spring Security  
### Basics of Security in Spring  
####Authentication Filter will call ->  Authentication Manager will call -> Authentication Provider will call -> User Detail Service and Password Encoder  
####Authentication Filter -> has the security context that has both Authentication Success Handler and Authentication Failure Handler  

## Simple basic security (Project name: basic-security)  

a. To enable security in spring all we need to do is add the following dependency in our pom.xml file 
```xml  
<dependency>  
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>  
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>  
</dependency>  
```  

b. When we start the server we will get a "Using generated security password:". This is the autogenerated password which keeps changing on every server startup.  

c. When we access any resource from the server all we need to do is use the default user name "user" and the auto generated password when the server starts up.  

## In-Memory Security (Project name: inmemory-security) - Custom Security type  

a. The above security cannot be used for real time senarios and hence we move to our next type which is the custom in-memory security.    

b. For this we need to extend a Configuration class with WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter and then over ride the two configure methods.   

c. We also need to inject a bean for password encoder bean which is mandatory in Spring security now.
