# Spring Security  

## Simple jar security (Project name: jar-security) - Basic security type

a. To enable security in spring all we need to do is add the following dependency in our pom.xml file 
```xml  
<dependency>  
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>  
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>  
</dependency>  
```  

b. When we start the server we will get a "Using generated security password:". This is the autogenerated password which keeps changing on every server startup.  

c. When we access any resource from the server all we need to do is use the default user name "user" and the auto generated password when the server starts up.  

## Basic Security (Project name: basic-security)  - Custom Security  

a. The above security cannot be used for real time senarios and hence we move to our next type which is the custom security. We have used an InMemory security for this example.  

b. For this we need to extend a Configuration class with WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter and then over ride two configure methods.   

c. We also need to inject a bean for password encoder bean which is mandatory in Spring security now.
